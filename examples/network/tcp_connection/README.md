The examples here demonstrate a cross-platform communication using TCP/IP with a "classic" client and server approach. The _Castle Game Engine_ shows the windows and user interface.

These examples depend on the `castle_indy` package (see in CGE `packages` subdirectory), which in turn depends on [Indy](https://www.indyproject.org/). Indy is not distributed with _Castle Game Engine_. See https://castle-engine.io/manual_network.php#section_indy about installing Indy.
